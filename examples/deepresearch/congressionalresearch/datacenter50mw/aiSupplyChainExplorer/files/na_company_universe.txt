# Note: Forward Networks and Anuta Networks are private companies and have been removed from this list. Hyperscalers (Google, Amazon, Microsoft) are intentionally excluded as they are not primarily suppliers/integrators to third parties but are major internal consumers and designers of AI hardware. See na_company_universe_review.txt for validation and rationale.
