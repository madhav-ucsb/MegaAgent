Review of companies_master.txt integration (Asia focus):

1. All companies from company_universe_asia.txt are present in companies_master.txt, including new Indian, Malaysian, Singaporean, and Southeast Asian entries (e.g., E2E Networks, Tata Elxsi, VITROX, INARI Amertron, AEM Holdings, UMS Holdings, Venture Corporation, Frencken Group, etc.).
2. Line format, units, and provenance fields are consistent with Asia and global standards.
3. Segment and region coverage is complete for Asia, including Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China, India, Malaysia, Singapore, and other key Southeast Asian markets.
4. No duplicate or missing entries detected for Asia. All major public suppliers and integrators are included.
5. Note fields and provenance are preserved for all new and legacy entries.
6. Integration note at the end of the file is present and correct.

Conclusion: Integration of the expanded and validated Asia company universe into companies_master.txt is complete and accurate. No further action required for this step.
