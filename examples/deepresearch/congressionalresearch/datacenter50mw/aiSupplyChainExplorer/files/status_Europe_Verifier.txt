- Validated all current entries in europe_risk_matrix.txt for completeness, consistency, and source documentation.
- Created and wrote europe_risk_matrix_review.txt, flagging missing companies and confirming all present entries are correct.
- Communicated findings and sent a reminder to Europe_RegEnergyAnalyst to add missing companies and notify me for re-validation.
- Ready to re-validate when new entries are available. All current tasks are complete and TODO list is clear.
