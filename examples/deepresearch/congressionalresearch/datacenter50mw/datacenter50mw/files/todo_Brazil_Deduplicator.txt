1. Monitor brazil_projects.txt for new or updated entries. 2. Review all project entries for potential duplicates, aliases, or near-duplicates. 3. For each duplicate/alias, update dedupe_map.txt with canonical name, alias, reason, and sources. 4. Communicate with Brazil_SourceCollector, Brazil_Geocoder, and Brazil_Verifier as needed. 5. Ensure deduplication is up-to-date as new data is added.
