Reviewed Equinix SG6, SG5, and SG2 for possible duplicate/alias/campus entries. Searched for official and industry references to campus/cluster operation. Determined all are distinct IBX facilities, not marketed or operated as a single campus, though described as a cluster in proximity. Documented minor naming variations for SG6 and clarified no deduplication required for the cluster in dedupe_map.txt with sources.
