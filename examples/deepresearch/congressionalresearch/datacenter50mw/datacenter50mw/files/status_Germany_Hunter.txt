Compiled and structured all confirmed 50MW+ AI datacenter projects in Germany (Colt DCS Frankfurt 4 & 5, Berlin 1 & 2; DATA CASTLE FRA1 and Berlin-Spandau; Virtus Berlin campus; SAP/DT/Ionos/Schwarz AI gigafactory proposal). Wrote all findings to germany_projects.txt in required schema. Escalated that additional searches for Munich and other secondary metros are temporarily blocked due to Perplexity API rate limits and requested Source Collectors or additional search capacity. Will resume comprehensive coverage for Munich and other regions/operators when API access is restored. Collaborated with Geocoders, Deduplicators, and Verifiers as needed.
