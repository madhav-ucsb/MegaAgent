Title: 50조원 규모 '세계 최대 AI 데이터센터' 한국 유치… 올해 착공 2028년 완공 목표
URL: https://dpg.danawa.com/news/view?boardSeq=60&listSeq=5754068
Content: 월스트리트저널(WSJ)이 18일(현지 시간) 보도한 내용에 따르면, 한국에 세계 최대 규모의 인공지능(AI) 데이터센터가 들어선다. 투자 규모는 최대 350억 달러(약 50조원)에 달한다. 이번 프로젝트는 스톡 팜 로드(Stock Farm Road) 투자그룹이 주도한다. LG그룹 창업주의 손자인 브라이언 구와 BADR 인베스트먼트의 설립자이자 최고경영자(CEO)인 아민 바드르엘딘이 공동 창립자다.

데이터센터의 전력 규모는 3기가와트(GW)로, 이는 미국에서 오픈AI(OpenAI)와 소프트뱅크(SoftBank)가 추진 중인 스타게이트(Stargate) 프로젝트의 약 3배에 달하는 규모다. 1기가와트는 75만~100만 가구가 사용할 수 있는 전력량이다.

WSJ은 이 데이터센터가 "서울에서 멀리 떨어진 남서부 지역"에 들어설 것이라고 보도했다. 올해 착공해 2028년 완공을 목표로 하고 있다. 투자 그룹은 전력과 수자원 확보를 위해 전라남도와 협약을 체결했다. 브라이언 구는 "현재 한국의 데이터센터는 주로 국내 수요를 맞추고 있지만, 한국은 세계 시장을 겨냥한 대규모 데이터센터를 운영할 수 있는 적절한 조건을 갖추고 있다"고 말했다.... 데이터센터 전문 리서치 업체인 DC바이트(DC Byte)의 징웬 옹 아시아 태평양 지역 담당 연구 매니저는 "비용을 절감하고 신속하게 건설할 수 있다면 한국 데이터센터가 충분한 경쟁력을 가질 수 있을 것"이라고 평가했다. 다만 데이터센터 건설을 위한 공급망 부족과 엔비디아(NVIDIA)의 AI 칩 공급난으로 인해 완공 시기가 2028년 이후로 미뤄질 가능성도 있다.

SK텔레콤/브로드밴드 AI DC 사업부장 하민용입니다. AI 시대의 혁신을 이끄는 핵심 인프라인 AI 데이터센터 관련, 당사 사업의 실체 있는 성과와 본격적인 추진에 대해 말씀드리고자 합니다. 이를 위해 지난 6월 20일 울산에서 진행된 ‘SK-AWS 울산 AI 데이터센터 출범식’의 의의와 향후 추진 계획, 그리고 중장기 사업 전략에 대해 설명 드리겠습니다.\n\n지난 6월 20일 SK텔레콤은 아마존 웹 서비스(AWS), SK그룹 관계사들과 함께 하이퍼스케일 AI DC 건립 계획을 발표했습니다. SK그룹의 풍부한 부지와 에너지 공급망(Supply Chain)이 확보된 울산 지역에서 글로벌 1위 클라우드 기업 AWS와 함께 국내 최대ㆍ최초의 하이퍼스케일 AI 전용 데이터센터를 건립함으로써, ‘AI 인프라 슈퍼 하이웨이(AI Infra Super Highway)’의 핵심 거점을 확보할 계획입니다.... ## 국내 최대ㆍ최초의 하이퍼스케일 AI 전용 데이터센터\n\n생성형 AI의 빅뱅과 함께, 데이터센터는 데이터를 저장하고 처리하는 공간에서, AI 모델을 학습하고 추론하는 고도화된 역할을 수행하게 되었습니다. 이러한 흐름을 반영하여, 울산 AI DC는 전력 소모와 발열 관리에 특화된 AI DC 솔루션을 제공하는 차별화된 데이터센터로 지어질 예정입니다.\n\n높은 컴퓨팅 파워를 구현하기 위해 초고집적 랙 밀도(rack density)를 구축하고, 고효율 냉각을 위해 공냉식과 수냉식을 결합한 하이브리드 냉각시스템을 도입할 계획입니다. 또한, AI DC 운영 환경을 최적화하는 DCIM(데이터센터 인프라 관리, Data Center Infrastructure Management)을 적용할 예정입니다. 울산 AI DC는 하이퍼스케일급 용량을 확보함과 동시에, 국내 어떤 사업자도 시도하지 않았던 최첨단 AI DC의 첫 사례라는 점에서 향후 당사 데이터센터 사업의 핵심 경쟁력으로 자리매김할 것으로 예상됩니다.\n\nWIS 2025에서 선보인 SKT의 AI 데이터센터 전시 부스... ## ’30년까지 추진 계획 – 203...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResult 3:\nTitle: SK, AWS와 함께 국내 최대 AI 데이터센터 울산에 짓기로\nURL: https://www.chosun.com/economy/industry-company/2025/06/15/6ZLUUFUNDBBJJOQOQKXPOLQ6FY/\nContent: SK그룹이 세계 1위 클라우드 기업 아마존웹서비스(AWS)와 손잡고 울산 미포 국가산업단지 부지에 초대형 인공지능(AI) 데이터센터를 구축한다. 그래픽처리장치(GPU) 6만 장이 투입되는 국내 최대 규모의 AI 전용 데이터센터다.\nSK그룹은 세계 1위 클라우드 기업 아마존웹서비스(AWS) 전용 AI 데이터센터를 울산에 짓기로 했다. 그래픽처리장치(GPU) 6만장이 투입되는 국내 최대 규모의 AI 데이터센터다. 사진은 SK브로드밴드의 서울 가산 AI 데이터센터(AIDC) 모습. /SK텔레콤\n15일 업계에 따르면 SK그룹은 이달 중 출범식을 열고 오는 8월 기공식을 개최할 예정이다. 이 데이터센터는 2027년 11월까지 1단계로 41MW(메가와트) 규모로 건설된 후 2029년 2월까지 103MW 규모로 완공될 계획이다. 향후에는 이를 1GW(기가와트) 규모로 확장해 동북아시아 최대 AI 데이터센터 허브로 만들겠다는 청사진도 그리고 있다.... SK그룹과 양사는 이번 데이터센터 구축을 위해 수조원을 공동 투자한다. AI 데이터센터 사업을 맡고 있는 SK텔레콤과 SK브로드밴드는 2028년까지 AI에 3조4000억원을 투자하겠다고 밝혔는데, AWS와의 합작 투자에만 수조원이 투입되는 것이다. SK그룹은 SK텔레콤뿐만 아니라 에너지(SK가스), 반도체(SK하이닉스) 등 그룹 역량을 총 결집해 이번 프로젝트에 나서고 있다. 업계에 따르면 AWS가 단독으로만 40억달러(약 5조4712억원)를 투자하기로 한 것으로 전해졌다.\nSK텔레콤이 AWS와 함께 짓겠다고 밝힌 GPU 6만장 규모의 데이터센터는 현재까지 발표된 국내 데이터센터 중 최대 규모다. 현재 정부가 건설 계획을 밝힌 AI 인프라 시설 \'국가 AI 컴퓨팅 센터\'에는 GPU가 1만5000장 투입될 계획인데, 민간 기업인 SK텔레콤이 이보다 4배 더 많은 GPU를 확보하겠다고 나선 것이다....

Supply vs demand imbalance 
KEPCO is the sole electricity supplier under the Electric Utility 
Act. KEPCO faces challenges in responding to recent increases in 
demand and developing its infrastructure to adapt to new trends 
and patterns (including the growth of the data centre sector). 
This has led to a significant amount of land banking in areas that 
benefit from existing infrastructure with available capacity.

Content: By Rack Height: 42U standard meets emerging 48U demand

The 42U format held 55.54% revenue in 2024, reflecting decades of entrenched compatibility with enterprise gear. Many colocation providers continue to bundle 42U cabinets with fixed cross-connect packages, securing predictable lead times. Yet AI training clusters now require extra vertical space for rear-door heat exchangers and GPU sleds, propelling the 48U category at a 13.12% CAGR. That uplift means the 48U slice of South Korea data center rack market size could challenge 42U dominance by the decade’s end as operators retrofit white space for taller doors and higher cable ducts. Facilities with raised floors taller than one meter are the earliest adopters because they already budget for heavier loads.

Higher racks also offset power-delivery constraints by allowing more SMR batteries and busbars per cabinet, spreading heat across a longer chimney. Vendors therefore reinforce frames with seismic bracing to pass Korea’s upgraded structural codes, which ...

Title: “한국에 50조원짜리 세계 최대 AI 데이터센터 건립 계획” WSJ
URL: https://ganaco.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=notice2&wr_id=466
Content: ## 본문

LG 그룹 창업주 손자 등이 주도하는 투자그룹이 한국에 세계 최대 AI 데이터센터 건립을 추진 중이라고 월스트리트저널(WSJ)이 18일(현지시간) 보도했다.

한 투자 그룹이 한국에 세계 최대 인공지능(AI) 데이터센터 건립을 추진하고 있다고 월스트리트저널(WSJ)이 18일(현지시간) 보도했다.

WSJ에 따르면 계획이 완성되면 한국에는 전력 사용량만 3기가와트에 이르는 총비용 350억달러(약 50조원)짜리 세계 최대 AI 데이터센터가 들어선다. WSJ은 전세계에 1기가와트 이상의 전력이 필요할 만큼 엄청난 규모의 AI 반도체가 집적된 곳은 없다고 지적했다.

1기가와트는 75만~100만 가구가 사용하는 전력량과 맞먹는다.

한국에 들어설 AI 데이터센터는 계획이 그대로 실현될 경우 현재 미국 스타게이트 프로젝트가 추진하는 텍사스 데이터센터 복합단지의 3배 가까운 규모다. 스타게이트는 지난달 도널드 트럼프 미국 대통령이 발표한 프로젝트로 오픈AI, 오라클, 일본 소프트뱅크 등이 참여하는 AI 데이터센터 계획이다.... 데이터센터 규모를 제한하는 것은 막대한 전력 소비량이다. 전력을 감당할 수 없어 초거대 AI 데이터센터 건립 계획 자체가 없었다.

리서치 그룹 에포크AI에 따르면 세계 최대 AI 모델을 개발하려면 2030년까지 5기가와트 이상의 전력이 필요하다.

미국에서는 땅값이 싸면서도 충분한 전력이 공급되고, 동시에 데이터 연결도 가능한 지역이 점점 귀해지고 있다. AI 데이터센터 확충 걸림돌이다.

특히 미 전력망이 낡을 대로 낡은 것이 최대 걸림돌이다.

WSJ은 한국 AI 데이터센터가 수도 서울에서 남쪽으로 크게 떨어진 전라남도에 들어선다고 전했다.

AI 데이터센터 착공은 올 초반 시작돼 2028년 완공이 목표다.

이 계획을 추진하는 투자 그룹은 ‘스탁 팜 로드(Stock Farm Road)’로 100억달러를 초기에 투자하고, 이후 규모를 350억달러까지 확대할 방침이다.

한국에 세계 최대 규모의 인공지능 데이터 센터 건설이 추진되고 있다고 월스트리트저널이 보도했습니다.

신문은 최대 350억 달러, 50조 원 가량이 투자될 예정인 데이터 센터의 전력 규모는 3기가와트로, 전 세계적으로 1기가와트 이상의 데이터 센터는 흔치 않다고 전했습니다.

이 프로젝트는 LG 창업자 손자인 브라이언 구가 공동 창립자로 있는 '스톡 팜 로드'라는 투자 그룹이 주도하고 있는 것으로 알려졌습니다.

월스트리트저널은 데이터 센터가 들어설 구체적인 장소는 언급하지 않았지만, 투자자들이 전라남도와 협약을 체결했다며 전남 지역일 가능성을 내비쳤습니다.

신문은 미국에서 오픈AI와 소프트뱅크가 추진 중인 스타게이트 프로젝트가 계획하는 텍사스 데이터 센터보다 3배 큰 규모라며 가장 큰 AI 모델을 개발하려면 2030년까지 5기가와트 이상 전력이 필요할 것으로 예상된다고 덧붙였습니다.

스톡 팜 로드는 초기 투자금으로 백억 달러를 투입하고 장기적으로 최대 350억 달러를 투자할 계획입니다.

브라이언 구는 현재 한국의 데이터 센터는 주로 국내 수요를 맞추고 있지만 한국은 세계 시장을 겨냥한 대규모 데이터 센터를 운영할 수 있는 적절한 조건을 갖추고 있다고 말했습니다.

월스트리트저널은 한국의 대규모 데이터 센터 계획은 인공지능 붐의 지속 가능성에 대한 우려에도 세계적으로 AI 수요가 폭발적으로 증가하고 있음을 보여준다고 설명했습니다.

Content: 최근 인공지능(AI) 산업의 폭발적인 성장과 함께 데이터 센터의 전력 소비가 주요 이슈로 떠오르고 있다. AI 모델이 점점 복잡해지면서 연산을 담당하는 칩의 수요가 급증하고, 이에 따라 데이터 센터의 전력 확보 문제가 새로운 도전 과제로 부상하고 있다.

이러한 상황에서

**한국 남서부 지역에 최대 3기가와트(GW) 규모의 AI 데이터 센터 건설 계획이 발표**되며 글로벌 AI 경쟁에 새로운 변화를 가져올 것으로 보인다. 이 프로젝트는 350억 달러(약 46조 원) 규모의 투자 계획과 함께 진행되며, 세계적으로도 손꼽히는 초대형 AI 데이터 센터로 자리 잡을 전망이다.

전 세계적으로

**AI 연산 수요가 폭발적으로 증가**하면서 데이터 센터의 전력 소비와 인프라 확장이 중요한 과제로 떠오르고 있다. 특히, **대규모 AI 모델을 학습하고 운영하기 위해서는 엄청난 양의 전력이 필요**하며, 이에 따라 글로벌 IT 기업들은 더 많은 전력을 확보할 수 있는 지역을 중심으로 데이터 센터를 확장하고 있다.... 그러나

**미국과 유럽에서는 데이터 센터 확장을 위한 전력과 부지 확보가 점점 어려워지고 있으며**, 이러한 문제를 해결하기 위해 **아시아 국가들이 대안으로 떠오르고 있다**. 이러한 가운데, **한국이 전라남도 지역에 최대 3기가와트(GW) 규모의 초대형 AI 데이터 센터를 건설할 계획을 발표**하면서 글로벌 AI 데이터 센터 경쟁에 새로운 변화를 예고하고 있다.

이번 프로젝트는

**350억 달러(약 46조 원) 규모의 대규모 투자**로 진행되며, 이는 단순한 국내 AI 인프라 확충을 넘어 **아시아 및 글로벌 AI 시장을 겨냥한 전략적 프로젝트**로 평가된다.

특히, 이번 프로젝트는

**미국에서 OpenAI와 소프트뱅크가 추진하는 ‘스타게이트(Stargate) 프로젝트’(1GW 규모)보다 약 3배 이상 큰 규모**로, AI 데이터 센터의 새로운 표준을 만들 것으로 보인다.

Title: 50조원 규모 '세계 최대 AI 데이터센터' 한국 유치… 올해 착공 2028년 ...
URL: https://aimatters.co.kr/news-report/ai-news/15048/
Content: 월스트리트저널(WSJ)이 18일(현지 시간) 보도한 내용에 따르면, 한국에 세계 최대 규모의 인공지능(AI) 데이터센터가 들어선다. 투자 규모는 최대 350억 달러(약 50조원)에 달한다. 이번 프로젝트는 스톡 팜 로드(Stock Farm Road) 투자그룹이 주도한다. LG그룹 창업주의 손자인 브라이언 구와 BADR 인베스트먼트의 설립자이자 최고경영자(CEO)인 아민 바드르엘딘이 공동 창립자다.

데이터센터의 전력 규모는 3기가와트(GW)로, 이는 미국에서 오픈AI(OpenAI)와 소프트뱅크(SoftBank)가 추진 중인 스타게이트(Stargate) 프로젝트의 약 3배에 달하는 규모다. 1기가와트는 75만~100만 가구가 사용할 수 있는 전력량이다.

WSJ은 이 데이터센터가 “서울에서 멀리 떨어진 남서부 지역”에 들어설 것이라고 보도했다. 올해 착공해 2028년 완공을 목표로 하고 있다. 투자 그룹은 전력과 수자원 확보를 위해 전라남도와 협약을 체결했다. 브라이언 구는 “현재 한국의 데이터센터는 주로 국내 수요를 맞추고 있지만, 한국은 세계 시장을 겨냥한 대규모 데이터센터를 운영할 수 있는 적절한 조건을 갖추고 있다”고 말했다.

데이터센터 전문 리서치 업체인 DC바이트(DC Byte)의 징웬 옹 아시아 태평양 지역 담당 연구 매니저는 “비용을 절감하고 신속하게 건설할 수 있다면 한국 데이터센터가 충분한 경쟁력을 가질 수 있을 것”이라고 평가했다. 다만 데이터센터 건설을 위한 공급망 부족과 엔비디아(NVIDIA)의 AI 칩 공급난으로 인해 완공 시기가 2028년 이후로 미뤄질 가능성도 있다.

Content: 오픈AI 샘 알트만 대표 접견 관련 김용범 정책실장·하정우 AI미래기획수석 브리핑2025.10.01



이재명 대통령은 오늘 오후 6시, 글로벌 AI 선도 기업인 오픈AI의 샘 알트만 대표를 만나 국내 기업과의 협력방안과 지역 AX 산업 활성화 방안 등에 대해 의견을 교환했습니다.

대통령 접견에 앞서 과기정통부와 오픈AI는 대한민국 AI 대전환과 AI 인프라 혁신을 가속화하기 위한 AI 분야 협력 MOU를 체결하였습니다. 또한 오픈AI는 삼성, SK와 각각 스타게이트 프로젝트 관련 메모리 반도체 협력 파트너십 LOI도 체결하였습니다.

이를 차례로 말씀드리겠습니다.

먼저 과기정통부와 오픈AI의 MOU를 설명드리겠습니다.

오픈AI는 지역 균형 발전을 위한 한국 정부의 정책방향에 깊이 공감하면서, 한국의 파트너 기업들과 함께 서남권(전남), 동남권(포항) 지역에 대규모 데이터센터 구축을 각각 추진하겠다고 밝혔습니다.... 이를 뒷받침하기 위해 체결된 이번 MOU는 오픈AI와 같은 글로벌 AI 선도기업이 국내 비수도권 지역에 AI 데이터센터를 구축‧운영하겠다는 의지를 밝혔다는 점에서 매우 의미가 크다고 하겠습니다.

이러한 글로벌 AI 선도기업과의 협력은 지역 산업과 연계한 AX 혁신을 가속화하고, 인재 양성과 스타트업 육성에도 좋은 계기가 될 것으로 기대합니다.

이는 지난 6월 SK그룹과 아마존웹서비스(AWS)의 울산 AI 데이터센터 구축, 7월 전남지역의 차세대 전력망 구축계획 발표, 지난주 대통령 방미 과정에서 이루어진 AI·에너지 인프라 투자를 위한 과기정통부‧블랙록과의 MOU 체결에 이은 중요한 성과입니다. 이는 이재명 정부가 전력을 다하여 추진하고 있는 글로벌 AI 3강 정책에 대해 국제사회와 글로벌 기업들의 높은 기대와 협력 의지가 반영될 것이라 하겠습니다.

이번 오픈AI와의 협력으로 전남, 포항 지역에 AI고속도로가 건설되어 산업·공공 부문의 AI 전환 정책이 본격적으로 탄력을 받고 지역경제 활성화에도 크게 기여할 것으로 기대합니다. 앞으로도 정부는 AI 인프라 조성과 지역 기반 A...

생성형 AI 확산으로 국내 데이터센터 산업이 빠르게 재편되고 있다. 데이터센터의 고성능 요구와 급증하는 전력 소비 속에서, 지속가능성과 기술 혁신을 동시에 달성하는 ‘그린 데이터센터’가 해법으로 부상하고 있다. 본 기고에서는 최근 개최된 <2025 데이터센터 서밋 코리아> 컨퍼런스를 바탕으로 국내 데이터센터 시장의 현주소와 SK에코플랜트가 선보이는 지속가능한 첨단 데이터센터 솔루션을 살펴본다.... **AI 전용 고성능 데이터센터**로 전환되고 있다. 고성능 데이터센터를 흔히 ‘AI 데이터센터’라 부르는데, 고성능 GPU·NPU를 활용하는 AI 데이터센터는 막대한 전력을 소비하고 높은 열을 발생시킨다. 이에 따라 효율적인 냉각 기술의 중요성도 급격히 커지고 있다.

결국 고성능 AI 데이터센터는 안정적인 전력 공급과 효율적인 냉각이 가능한 입지가 무엇보다 중요하다. 최근에는 데이터센터 후보지를 수도권보다는 전력 계통에 여유가 있고, 에너지 활용 효율이 높은 발전소 인근이나 해안가, 수자원 접근이 용이한 지방으로 이전하려는 움직임이 나타나고 있다.

실제로 수도권에 집중돼 있던 데이터센터 입지가 최근에는 지방으로 분산되는 흐름도 뚜렷해지고 있다. 계획 단계에 있는 신규 국내 데이터센터 39개소 가운데 82.1%가 비수도권에 위치하고 있는 것이다. 전력 및 냉각 효율 측면에서 지방 입지의 지리적 이점이 부각되고 정부의 지방 분산 정책이 본격화되며 지방을 데이터센터 구축지로 고려하는 사례가 늘어나고 있음을 보여준다.... AI 전용 고성능 데이터센터 구축에도 나선다. SK에코플랜트는 SK그룹과 아마존웹서비스(AWS)가 함께 울산에 조성 중인 국내 최대 규모의 AI 특화 데이터센터 구축 프로젝트에 참여하게 됐다. 울산 데이터센터 프로젝트는 7조 원 규모, 1GW급 전력 용량의 초대형 AI 전용 데이터센터로 아시아·태평양 지역 최대 AI 허브로의 도약을 목표로 한다.

SK에코플랜트는 이 프로젝트에서 최적의 인프라 구축과 설계 역량을 바탕으로 핵심 파트너 역할을 수행한...

Title: SKT “AI 중심 데이터센터, 수도권 보다 지방이 더 유리”

Content: SK텔레콤이 아마존웹서비스(AWS)와 함께 울산에 국내 최대 규모의 AI 데이터센터를 구축하는 가운데, AI 기술 발전에 따라 데이터센터 입지 선호도도 변화하고 있다고 3일 밝혔다.

이날 하민용 SK텔레콤·브로드밴드 AI DC 사업부장(부사장)은 SKT 뉴스룸에 올린 임원 칼럼을 통해 울산 AI 데이터센터(AI DC) 사업의 구체적 계획과 산업 환경의 변화 양상을 소개했다.

하 부사장은 “기존 데이터센터는 데이터 저장과 처리를 중심으로 해 수도권 입지가 중요했지만, AI 데이터센터는 AI 모델의 학습 및 추론이 핵심이어서 충분한 전력과 넓은 부지, 글로벌 확장성이 더 중요해졌다”고 설명했다.

SK텔레콤과 AWS가 함께 추진 중인 울산 미포산단 AI 데이터센터는 2027년 가동 예정이다. 인근의 SK멀티유틸리티 발전소에서 300MW(메가와트)급 전력을 안정적으로 공급받아 한국전력보다 저렴한 가격으로 전력을 확보할 수 있다.

또한 데이터센터 내 랙 배치를 밀도 높게 설계하고, 공냉식과 수냉식을 결합한 하이브리드 방식의 고효율 냉각 시스템을 도입해 효율성과 안정성을 동시에 확보할 계획이다.

울산은 산업단지 내에 위치해 소음·전자파 관련 민원 우려가 적고, SK에너지·SK이노베이션 등 그룹 계열사가 다수 입지해 향후 기가와트(GW)급 확장 시에도 부지 확보에 유리하다.

특히 울산은 국제 해저케이블 육양지인 부산과 40km 거리이며, SK브로드밴드의 부산 해저케이블을 통해 북미·아태 지역과 초고속망으로 연결 가능해 글로벌 AI 데이터 수요까지 수용할 수 있다는 점이 강점으로 꼽힌다.

하 부사장은 “서울 구로에 건설 예정인 데이터센터까지 포함하면 2030년까지 총 300MW 이상을 확보하게 되며, 이를 통해 연간 1조 원 규모의 매출 창출도 가능할 것”이라고 전망했다.

##### Feb 19, 2025 (0:01:28)
한국에 세계 최대 규모의 인공지능 데이터 센터 건설이 추진되고 있다고 월스트리트저널이 보도했습니다.

신문은 최대 350억 달러, 50조 원 가량이 투자될 예정인 데이터 센터의 전력 규모는 3기가와트로, 전 세계적으로 1기가와트 이상의 데이터 센터는 흔치 않다고 전했습니다.

이 프로젝트는 LG 창업자 손자인 브라이언 구가 공동 창립자로 있는 '스톡 팜 로드'라는 투자 그룹이 주도하고 있는 것으로 알려졌습니다.

월스트리트저널은 데이터 센터가 들어설 구체적인 장소는 언급하지 않았지만, 투자자들이 전라남도와 협약을 체결했다며 전남 지역일 가능성을 내비쳤습니다.

신문은 미국에서 오픈AI와 소프트뱅크가 추진 중인 스타게이트 프로젝트가 계획하는 텍사스 데이터 센터보다 3배 큰 규모라며 가장 큰 AI 모델을 개발하려면 2030년까지 5기가와트 이상 전력이 필요할 것으로 예상된다고 덧붙였습니다.

스톡 팜 로드는 초기 투자금으로 백억 달러를 투입하고 장기적으로 최대 350억 달러를 투자할 계획입니다.

브라이언 구는 현재 한국의 데이터 센터는 주로 국내 수요를 맞추고 있지만 한국은 세계 시장을 겨냥한 대규모 데이터 센터를 운영할 수 있는 적절한 조건을 갖추고 있다고 말했습니다.

월스트리트저널은 한국의 대규모 데이터 센터 계획은 인공지능 붐의 지속 가능성에 대한 우려에도 세계적으로 AI 수요가 폭발적으로 증가하고 있음을 보여준다고 설명했습니다.

Content: 민원 잦고 ‘전기 먹는 하마’ 평

지자체들도 기피하는 시설

공항 운영과 관련 없어 ‘갸웃’

인천국제공항공사가 공항 운영과는 상관없는 AI데이터센터 유치에 나서면서 잡음이 일고 있다. 전기 먹는 하마로 불리는 데이터센터는 전자파 문제 등으로 인한 민원이 많아 지자체들이 유치를 꺼리는 기피시설이다.

8일 인천공항공사에 따르면 공사는 인재·기술·산업·문화가 융합하는 미래 플랫폼 조성을 위해 제2여객터미널 국제업무지역 15만6000㎡에 ‘AI 혁신 허브’ 조성을 추진 중이다.

공사는 AI 혁신 허브의 첫 번째 단계로 1만7611㎡에 AI 데이터센터를 유치하기로 했다. 최대 40㎿의 전력 규모로 조성될 데이터센터는 조만간 공모를 통해 사업자를 선정할 계획이다. 2026년 착공해 2028년 완공을 목표로 하고 있다.이 과정에서 아마존과 엔비디아, 마이크로소프트, 인텔 등 빅데크 기업뿐 아니라 연구·개발(R&D)센터, 벤처기업 등으로 구성된 산·학·연 생태계 조성을 한다는 것이다.... 인천공항공사는 또 2031년까지 100㎿ 이상의 하이퍼스케일 AI 데이터센터도 추가로 조성할 계획이다. 인천공항공사 관계자는 “하이퍼스케일의 AI 데이터센터가 조성되면 인천공항은 국가 대표 다기능 데이터센터로 자리매김하는 것은 물론 로봇·사물인터넷·AI·자율주행 등 첨단기술을 실증할 수 있는 AI산업 클러스터가 조성되는 것”이라고 말했다.

하지만 데이터센터는 인천공항 운영과 관련이 없는 시설이다. 전자파 우려 등으로 수도권 자치단체마다 꺼리는 기피시설인데 굳이 인천공항에서 유치에 나서는 것이 이해되지 않는다는 지적도 나온다.

인천공항에 근무하는 한 직원은 “대학과 R&D 센터, 벤처기업 등의 유치는 자치단체의 업무”라며 “인천공항공사가 수도권에서 조성하지 못하는 데이터센터를 인천공항에 건립하려는 의도가 아닌지 의심스럽다”고 말했다.

특히 인천공항공사는 데이터센터 유치를 추진하면서 전기를 공급하는 한국전력과는 협의조차 하지 않은 것으로 파악됐다.... 공항신도시 맞은편에 있는 인천공항 열병합발전소는 자본잠식 상황으로 전...

차세대 먹거리로 수도권의 하이퍼 스케일 데이터센터에 주목해 온 국내 건설업계가 최근 지방 산업단지와 소형 데이터센터로 눈길을 돌리고 있다. 수도권 내 데이터센터의 고질적인 인허가 지연 문제와 공급 과잉 우려가 불안요소로 부상한 탓이다. 15일 업계에 따르면 인천 부평구 청천동에 들어서는 3만9789여㎡의 데이터센터 건설과 관련해 지난해부터 이어진 시행사와 주민 간 갈등이 최근 봉합 국면에 들어섰다.

정부가 대전 대덕연구단지 등 대학, 연구기관 등이 모인 국내 연구개발특구에 데이터센터 건축을 허용한다. 건물 건폐율·용적률도 약 33% 늘려 많은 기업과 연구인력을 수용할 수 있도록 할 방침이다. 과학기술정보통신부는 14일 이러한 내용을 담은 '연구개발특구의 육성에 관한 특별법(이하 '연구개발특구법') 시행령' 개정안을 공포하고 오는 8월15일부터 시행할 예정이라고 밝혔다. 이번 시행령 개정은 지난해 11월 대덕특구 50주년 미래비전선포식, 지난 2월 윤석열 대통령이 대전에서 주재한 민생토론회 등에서 제기된 연구개발특구 토지 이용 고도화의 일환이다.... 미국 에너지 규제 당국이 10여 년 만에 전력망 관련 규칙을 개정했다. 전기자동차 등 탄소중립 추진에 따른 ‘모든 것의 전기화’, 인공지능(AI) 데이터센터 열풍으로 폭증하는 전기 수요를 충족하기 위해서다. 조 바이든 행정부가 친환경 산업 공급망을 육성하기 위해 통과시킨 인플레이션 감축법(IRA)의 효과가 더욱 탄력을 받을 것이란 전망이 나온다. 미국 연방에너지규제위원회(FERC)는 13일(현지시간) “전력망 계획 및 자금 조달 방식에 대한 새로운 규칙을 의결했다”고 발표했다.

작년 말 기준 전 세계에서 운영하는 데이터센터(IDC)는 1만1000여곳에 육박한다. 미국과 독일, 영국, 중국, 한국을 중심으로 빠르게 증설되고 있다. 특히 미국 북버지니아는 전 세계 온라인 트래픽의 3분의 1 이상을 처리하는 세계 최대 데이터시장으로 군림하고 있다. 인공지능(AI)의 등장은 데이터 트래픽을 기하급수적으...

Title: AI가 바꾼 데이터센터의 패러다임

Content: **AI가 바꾼 데이터센터의 패러다임**

생성형 AI 확산으로 국내 데이터센터 산업이 빠르게 재편되고 있다. 데이터센터의 고성능 요구와 급증하는 전력 소비 속에서, 지속가능성과 기술 혁신을 동시에 달성하는 ‘그린 데이터센터’가 해법으로 부상하고 있다. 본 기고에서는 최근 개최된 <2025 데이터센터 서밋 코리아> 컨퍼런스를 바탕으로 국내 데이터센터 시장의 현주소와 SK에코플랜트가 선보이는 지속가능한 첨단 데이터센터 솔루션을 살펴본다.... **AI 전용 고성능 데이터센터**로 전환되고 있다. 고성능 데이터센터를 흔히 ‘AI 데이터센터’라 부르는데, 고성능 GPU·NPU를 활용하는 AI 데이터센터는 막대한 전력을 소비하고 높은 열을 발생시킨다. 이에 따라 효율적인 냉각 기술의 중요성도 급격히 커지고 있다.

결국 고성능 AI 데이터센터는 안정적인 전력 공급과 효율적인 냉각이 가능한 입지가 무엇보다 중요하다. 최근에는 데이터센터 후보지를 수도권보다는 전력 계통에 여유가 있고, 에너지 활용 효율이 높은 발전소 인근이나 해안가, 수자원 접근이 용이한 지방으로 이전하려는 움직임이 나타나고 있다.

실제로 수도권에 집중돼 있던 데이터센터 입지가 최근에는 지방으로 분산되는 흐름도 뚜렷해지고 있다. 계획 단계에 있는 신규 국내 데이터센터 39개소 가운데 82.1%가 비수도권에 위치하고 있는 것이다. 전력 및 냉각 효율 측면에서 지방 입지의 지리적 이점이 부각되고 정부의 지방 분산 정책이 본격화되며 지방을 데이터센터 구축지로 고려하는 사례가 늘어나고 있음을 보여준다.... AI 전용 고성능 데이터센터 구축에도 나선다. SK에코플랜트는 SK그룹과 아마존웹서비스(AWS)가 함께 울산에 조성 중인 국내 최대 규모의 AI 특화 데이터센터 구축 프로젝트에 참여하게 됐다. 울산 데이터센터 프로젝트는 7조 원 규모, 1GW급 전력 용량의 초대형 AI 전용 데이터센터로 아시아·태평양 지역 최대 AI 허브로의 도약을 목표로 한다.

SK에코플랜트는 이 프로젝트에서 최적의 인프라 구축과 설계 역량을 바탕으로 핵심 파트너 역할을 수행한...

AI 전용 고성능 데이터센터 구축에도 나선다. SK에코플랜트는 SK그룹과 아마존웹서비스(AWS)가 함께 울산에 조성 중인 국내 최대 규모의 AI 특화 데이터센터 구축 프로젝트에 참여하게 됐다. 울산 데이터센터 프로젝트는 7조 원 규모, 1GW급 전력 용량의 초대형 AI 전용 데이터센터로 아시아·태평양 지역 최대 AI 허브로의 도약을 목표로 한다.\n\nSK에코플랜트는 이 프로젝트에서 최적의 인프라 구축과 설계 역량을 바탕으로 핵심 파트너 역할을 수행한...\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n'}
